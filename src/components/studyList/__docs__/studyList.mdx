# Simple Dialog

Its similar to a modal but we can pass its style as props and manipulate it as we want. 
Initially used to display tool data changes in our Viewport.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
    <State initial={{

    }}>
        {({ state, setState }) => (
            <>
                <StudyList />
            </>
        )}
    </State>
</Playground>

## API

<Props of={StudyList} />
